When: the model has a property of type you pass this property to using the overload that only accepts the lambda expression you have an editor template for the type under Views/Shared/EditorTemplates then the MVC engine will automatically invoke the editor template for each item in the enumerable sequence, producing a list of the results. E.g., when there is a model class with property : And there is a view Views/Shared/EditorTemplates/OrderLine.cshtml: Then, when you invoke from the top-level view, you will get a page with text boxes for each order line, not just one. However, as you can see in the linked question, this only works when you use that particular overload of . If you provide a template name (in order to use a template that is not named after the class), then the automatic sequence handling will not happen, and a runtime error will happen instead. At which point you will have to declare your custom template's model as and manually iterate over its items in some way or another to output all of them, e.g. And that is where problems begin. The HTML controls generated in this way all have same ids and names. When you later POST them, the model binder will not be able to construct an array of s, and the model object you get in the HttpPost method in the controller will be . This makes sense if you look at the lambda expression - it does not really link the object being constructed to a place in the model from which it comes. I have tried various ways of iterating over the items, and it would seem the only way is to redeclare the template's model as and enumerate it with : Then in the top-level view: which gives properly named HTML controls that are properly recognized by the model binder on a submit.

I often find it not enough, and MVC is at version 5.1 already, so one'd expect these problems to be solved already. @ojf I have seen this post, but it does not help. If you `select(value,i)` with `IEnumerable` as the model, you'd then have to call `EditorFor(m => m.ElementAt(item.i).PropertyName)`, and that creates HTML without indices, just like regular `foreach` would, because `ElementAt` is not recognized by Razor in this way. @Jaider I'm using MVC 5.2 if that makes a difference.

So, I hacked this up. I did realize that only the final level would have entries, not all the levels. But, I fixed that issue, by returning either the emailAddress or emailType in that case, and returning an array as the final child.

In short, I have an element: And then JS in the element that does I'm trying to figure out how to stylize the drop-down once its been moved, but Polymer/Web Components' CSS isolation is preventing me from doing that.";"@Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- Yes, I do. While I appreciate your opinion and potential help with the issue, please don't treat people like their answer is immediately wrong without knowing details. The problem is very simple -- I have a ""select box"" where the drop-down is getting hidden in some cases because the parent nodes either have overflow: hidden or they simply have a stacking context set. As my drop-down needs to go on top of _everything on the page_, the solution is to pull it out of the node's shadow DOM in one way or the other. @Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- That's not at all true. Custom elements are meant to be contained, but the very nature of certain things (select-boxes, global popups/overlays, drag-drops, etc), combined with the restrictive nature of certain aspects of HTML, _require_ modification of the global DOM to accomplish certain tasks. The elements are still logically isolated, but their display isn't always. In addition, certain elements like _core-drag-drop_ do the same thing and append to `document.body`. You're basically saying ""never write a select box as a web-component"". Nobody would agree with that. @Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- Is it? How else do you propose writing a select box? Requiring that the surrounding UI be aware of the web-component internals breaks isolation significantly more than what I'm proposing. The JS side of things is a simple hack, yes, but the question wasn't about that, it was about the CSS side of things, specifically if it's possible to pull CSS out of the Shadow DOM (without doing it via JS, which requires modifying/moving all the rules). I honestly don't want to have an internet-fight here :) If you have a valid solution, I'd love to hear it, but ""don't"" isn't one. @Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- Further, polymer significantly pollutes all of their layout CSS (`horizontal layout`, etc...) @Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- eh, I'm writing a custom element to promote any of the parent element's CSS selectors that start with `body` right now :) @Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- But that doesn't apply once I move the element to body @Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- elements _can't_ escape stacking context. The moment I have something with `position:relative;z-index:1;`, and another similar element next to it, the drop-down can never go over the following element. Similar issue with `overflow: hidden`. I really don't want the app to have to be aware of the internals of the drop-down. @Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- select boxes don't take up space, so you'd need to absolutely position your node to see what I mean. Anyway, I created an element that is solely responsible for pulling out CSS, see my answer. @Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- Thanks :) I've been creating a number of such elements, like one that allows me to override internal templates with external ones. @Mike'Pomax'Kamermans -- damn it. Polymer can't route events when I do this... gah! Okay, looks like I'm going to have to make the drop-down piece its own element";578895;"Trusted"

The object itself is the view model. The binding binds them together and inserts the resulting self-contained UI component in the containing element. Looking around for similar patterns, it looks like Durandal has a binding that is pretty close: Except that (I think) would have to be a path to some HTML resource in their AMD-based module system. I just make it an HTML string that I can with a suitably extended CommonJS.

For example, let's say it's a routing algorithm, and on window running on a separate thread, I want to show the user what routes are being currently being analyzed and such, and for whatever reason, it contains heavily CPU-intensive code. The important thing is that I don't want to slow down the worker thread just for the sake of displaying progress; it needs to run at full-speed as much as possible. It is perfectly OK if the user sees stale data, such as an in-between that didn't actually occur (say, two active routes at once), because this progress visualization is for informational purposes only, and nothing else. From a theoretical standpoint, I think that according to the C++ standard, my best option is to use with on both threads. But that would slow down the code on the worker thread noticeably. From a practical standpoint, though, I'm just tempted to ignore altogether, and just have the worker thread work with all the variables normally. Who cares if the GUI thread reads stale data? i don't, and presumably neither will the user. In reality it won't matter because there is only one worker thread, and only that thread needs to observe valid writes, which in practice is the only thing that'll happen. What I'm wondering about is: What is the best way to solve this kind of problem, both in theory and in practice?

We configure exe's at runtime saying what dlls are loaded, and therefore what handlers are available to the app. We do this because we have custom handling for some customers, also it allows great flexibility because we can quickly develop new handlers in isolation, and test and deploy them with confidence that we haven't even touched any other parts of a running application. We can also patch handlers by simply dropping in a single replacement dll, we have customers with strict change management procedures and they adore this. To do this the pattern relies on two levels of factories, specific factories that implement specific handlers, and an overarching factory (which we call a Provider). The Provider chooses which handler factory to use to create a handler. The question: Does Windsor contain something that would simplify this process for us? Specifically I'm looking for something that could omit the Handler factory objects, it feels like something it should be able to do. I've read up on the and the & methods, but I can't see how they'd be any help here.

Thanks for any tips.";"@Bergi: I get a timeout if I don't use AJAX calls and simply post the entire page and process everything at one. I'm looking at AJAX as a better solution. @dragonslovetacos: I fear that approach would produce a timeout as the number of items could be a thousand or more. For that reason, I think I need to avoid processing everything at once. @Bergi: The only thing I'm doing in the loop is getting the data I need from the current element in order to submit the AJAX call. @Bergi: I'm not sure exactly how that would work. Making multiple requests from the client to the server would solve the problem because each request would be short. But I'm certainly open to considering a better approach. Do you know of any examples? @Bergi: I know my approach will take longer overall, but it will prevent time outs. As indicated, I'm open to a better way, but I'm sorry, I'm not getting a good picture of an alternative approach from your description. As indicated in my question, I think it should be asynchronous.

Anyway, looks like you've finished here. @hex494D49: Sorry, I did follow the link and I didn't understand it. Looking at the solution for the first question, I see a loop that makes AJAX calls. It uses a simple `for` loop, which isn't multi-tasking. I'm also trying to figure out how I would know when these AJAX calls have all completed. @hex494D49: Thanks. As you can see, JavaScript is not my main area of expertise. So I'm understanding that the `for` loop is not multi-threading, but the calls being made from that loop are asynchronous so it doesn't really matter. I think I agree this is the basic approach I need. As far as knowing when the calls are done, I'd prefer to just use `$.post()` so I don't plan to have a `XMLHttpRequest` object around.

Outside a string literal, a compiler could infer that is supposed to have the same meaning as an open-brace character is defined to have, even if the compiler character set doesn't have an open-brace character. Indeed, the whole purpose of trigraphs is to allow the use of sequences of representable characters to be used in place of characters that aren't representable. The spec requires that trigraphs even be processed within string literals, however, which has me puzzled. If a compiler's character set includes a character, the compiler can allow to be represented as , but the character set includes I see no reason a programmer wouldn't simply use that.

If the character set is known, one could simply use `0x7B` or `'\x7B` even if one couldn't type `{`. And for string (vs character) literals, a ""stringize"" macro could probably yield better looking results `#define LBR __stringize(??<)` would define `LBR` as `""{""` [whatever the `{` character is]. @mafso: With regard to 0x7B, I said ""if the character set is known"". Otherwise, do any trigraphs other than `??/` provide any functionality which couldn't have been accomplished by specifying a .h file with macros for characters [e.g. `#define __LBR {`/`#define __clbr 0x7B`/`#define __SLBR __STRINGIZE(<:)`]? @mafso: The quoted rationale talks about character sets which *don't have* certain glyphs. I see nothing about ease of typing. If one is using a system which has mapped 0x7B to `é` and 0x7D to `è`, and which doesn't *have* glyphs for `{` and `}`, I can see that `int main(void) <: doSomething(); :>` could be better than `int main(void) é doSomething(); é`. I would guess that `""l'??ve""` would probably render as `""l'éléve""` rather than `""l'{l}ve""` on such a machine, but I don't know of anything in the spec that would say that. @mafso: That would make sense; I wonder if there's anything that officially defines things in such terms (e.g. saying that there must exist a single-byte character that a compiler will recognize syntactically in the fashion defined for `{`, and `??<` must expand to that character).

Registration is usually done declaratively: The above makes the IoC container aware of the type A. It discovers A's dependencies through reflection. Registration can also happen through functions that act as factories. These functions are often lambdas and may be written inline: Being able to provide factory functions is especially useful when you have a type that needs to be parameterized with a dependency that's not a service, such as the name in the example above. As C# supports interfaces and abstract classes, it's frequently not the concrete data type that's important but instead the abstract type that it implements. In these cases you'll register the type as the interface or abstract class under which it should be available: With the above registration, any attempt to request a would fail, but a request for an would succeed. Concept 2: Container Creation & the Composition Root Once all of the registrations have been performed, the container needs to be created: The container is created very early in the program lifecycle and becomes the composition root -- the location within the code that composes all the pieces of the application, ensuring that all the necessary dependencies are created. The container is then used to resolve the main component within the application: Concept 3: Lifetime & instance management Given: If we want a new instance of A created for every dependency, it can be registered as without need to specify anything further. If we want the same instance of A to be returned every time we need to register it as a 'SingleInstance': Sometimes we want to share an instance within a certain scope but for different scopes we want different instances. For example, we might want to share a single database connection within all DAOs used to process a specific HTTP request. This is typically done by creating a new scope for each HTTP request and then ensuring that the new scope is used to resolve the dependencies. In Autofac this can be controlled manually as follows: General Patterns Pattern 1: A needs an instance of B The IoC container uses reflection to discover the dependency on B and inject it. Pattern 2: A needs a B at some point in the future In this pattern the instantiation of the dependency needs to be delayed for some reason. In this case, let's assume that B is a plugin created by a 3rd party and whose construction may fail. In order to safely work with it the object construction would have to be guarded. Pattern 3: A needs to create instances of B This pattern is typically used when there's a need to create multiple instances of a non value object. This also allows the creation of the instance to be deferred but usually does so for different reasons than those in Pattern 2 (A needs a B at some point in the future). Pattern 4: A provides parameters of types X and Y to B. This pattern is typically used when an injected dependency needs to be controlled or configured. Consider, for example, a DAO that needs a database connection string provided: Pattern 5: A needs all the kinds of B In this pattern multiple registrations are made for a given type. The consumer can then request all instances of the type and use them accordingly. Pattern 6: A needs to know about B, OR A needs to know X about B Let's again say that we have a system that uses plugins. The plugins may be enabled or disabled or reordered at the user's will. By associating metadata with each plugin the system can ignore inactive plugins, or put the plugins in the order desired by the user. Pattern 7: Composition of the patterns above In this code sample we request a list of all plugins wrapped in a Lazy object so that they can be created or resolved at some point in the future. This allows their instantiation to be guarded or filtered. Pattern 8: Adapters This example taken from: The above allows all the commands registered to be automatically adapted into a making them easy to add to a GUI. Pattern 9: Decorators Summary First, although I've tried to make the examples reasonably represent the described pattern these are illustrative toy examples that may not be ideal because of space constraints. What's more important to me are the concepts, patterns, and nearest JavaScript equivalents. If most IoC/DI containers in JavaScript don't support some of the patterns above because there are far easier ways to do it, fair enough. What are the nearest equivalents to the concepts and patterns described below in JavaScript?";"";103842;"Trusted"

If you want the oldest or newest file in a directory, don't use -- read Bash FAQ 99 instead. If you truly need a list of all the files in a directory in order by mtime so that you can process them in sequence, switch to perl, and have your perl program do its own directory opening and sorting. Then do the processing in the perl program, or -- worst case scenario -- have the perl program spit out the filenames with NUL delimiters. Even better, put the modification time in the filename, in YYYYMMDD format, so that glob order is also mtime order. Then you don't need ls or perl or anything. (The vast majority of cases where people want the oldest or newest file in a directory can be solved just by doing this.) Does that mean there is no native way of doing it in ? I don't have the liberty to modify the filename to include the time in them.

This can cause a conflict when using POSIX functions, for instance, when converting between data types such as floats and strings, since the notation may differ between locales.

But, Javascript is a garbage collected language and this is exactly the kind of things that you're not supposed to have to worry about in a garbage collected environment. If the variable holding the file descriptor goes out of scope or becomes unreachable from your code it seems that the node.js garbage collector should know that and properly clean up the system resource for you. Javascript in a browser does this with DOM objects. If a DOM object has been removed from the DOM and is held in a Javascript variable that then goes out of scope or becomes unreachable, the browser will automatically clean it up for you. You don't have to manually delete it. So, certainly this level of integration with non-JS resources is possible. So, I'm wondering why node.js doesn't have this capability as it seems it would be very useful and would make it a much more robust server development environment? Is this just a case of node.js being fairly early in its development and this might be a logical improvement over time, but for now there are more important things to work on? Is this a case of node.js staying at arm's length with the V8 engine and thus not getting integrated to the level that would be required to garbage collect system handles? Is there some conceptual difficulty that makes doing GC of file handles or other system resources like them impractical?";"My understanding is that it never closes the file handles unless you call `fs.close(fd)` or `fs.closeSync(fd)`. The problem probably stems from the fact that the file descriptors in node.js are just plain old numbers (not objects) so the JS engine just treats them as a number (e.g. nothing to do when garbage collecting other than free the space occupied by the number). I think the file descriptors would have to be an object that the JS engine knows something about for the JS engine to have a chance at doing something more intelligent with them. Which begs the question as to why node.js didn't make file descriptors actually objects so it could do GC with them.";816620;"Trusted"
