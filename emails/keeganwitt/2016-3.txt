Curious...it worked on both my Windows 10 home machine and my Windows 7
work machine.  What's you're JAVA_HOME environment variable set to?  Is it
a JDK?I'm thinking maybe your JAVA_HOME isn't set, and you can't pass where Java
is as an arg because groovy.cdoesn't
take any args for groovyConsole.  I've been meaning to update the native
binaries, we've been in need of some changes for a while.  But first I
wanted to move it over to GNU Make so we can actually reliably build these
things (or change to Launch4j -- I'm not sure I get the original author's
objections to that idea).  I just haven't gotten it done yet...In the mean time, I'd look at setting your JAVA_HOME, or j.ust keep using
the batch file.-KeeganOn Fri, Mar 18, 2016 at 9:51 AM, Winnebeck, Jason <
