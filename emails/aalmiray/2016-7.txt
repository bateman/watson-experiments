Hmm looks like we missed `ColorPicker` in the 8.0.0 release. If you could
create an issue
at In the meantime, you can manually register a factory that can handle a
`colorPicker` node, like this    SceneGraphBuilder sgb = new SceneGraphBuilder()
    sgb.registerFactory('colorPicker', new ControlFactory(ColorPicker))Cheers,
