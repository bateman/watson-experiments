AFAIK you can't use Javadoc doclets without relaying on the Javadoc API,
this is why you can't use Asciidoclet with Groovydoc (believe, I tried
several options).
Wrapping a doclet and adapting it for Groovydoc is not an option either
(tried that too).The only option for standard doclets to work with Groovydoc is for
Groovydoc to be base don the standard Javadoc API.-------------------------------------------
