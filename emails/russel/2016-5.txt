Â I haven't really played with any performance aspects recently. Until
after /dev/summer 2016 (a one day conference not a special device to
bring proper weather to the UK) I really won't have much time to play.
Maybe we should raise this again late-June and give it a go. This would
fit well with me trying to get a GPars 2.0 release out of the door.-- 
Russel.
