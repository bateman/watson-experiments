I am not sure how the Windows installer builds and tests, does it build
the native installer for Groovy?The native launcher repository last ran tests using Groovy 1.7.4: the
Groovy version is effectively a parameter. If Joachin tests with the
version of Groovy being packaged and it works, that is great news.I need to switch from using Bamboo as the test framework to using
something else, Travis, CodeShip,â€¦? (and put a test status marker in
the README.)Gant is an ex thing. It's only user is GINT. Though IntelliJ IDEA still
ships support for it.--
