The annual ACCU conference is being held in Bristol, UK for 2016. The
call for sessions is currently open, to close 2015-11-13 (yes, it is a
Friday :-)Although ACCU originates from a C and C++ background, and there is a
strong C++ flavour still, it has over the years got solid Java, Python,
C#, Ruby, Lisp, agile processes, and wider topics in the programme: it
is fundamentally about professional quality programming and techniques.
There have even been sessions on Groovy, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Ceylon,
Clojure,â€¦ in past years!If anyone in the JVM-related ecosphere would like to submit a session
or two, I think it would be good to retain having strong content in
this conference, and years to come.The call for sessions is atl_for_sessions--
