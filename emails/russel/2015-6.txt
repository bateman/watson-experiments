Graeme,Thanks for this. My preference was always to switch from JIRA to GitHub
issues given the code is a GitHub repository. However, some people
wanted to continue using JIRA, so I didn't do anything myself during
the lead up to the Codehaus switch-off. I had hoped that someone would
take on board finding a JIRA instance to relocate to.In the same way that we didn't transfer email list but just started
again, I am now minded just to get people to post into GitHub Issues
any GPars problems that were in JIRA that are still felt to be
problems.-- 
Russel.
