[â€¦]And if you run without -f on the command line you get:fval[false] class[java.lang.Boolean]
fvalue[false]So I think we are looking at this being a feature of options with the
optionalArg property set. Without it not having an argument to -f
fails.Thinking about this, I would say it is right that this behaviour is a
feature, and that it is what the code has asked for: an option that can
deliver presence or a value. When the is a value deliver it, otherwise
deliver a Boolean stating whether the flag was present.Clearly managing this type of option is non-trivial, but I think this
is not a bug.--
