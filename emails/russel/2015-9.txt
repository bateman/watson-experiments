Jim,You beat me to it again :-)Updating the Gradle version number in build.gradle, running the wrapper
task, running all the tests for a green, and if green committing, and
then creating a pull request is the exact process.[â€¦]As far as I am aware there are no missing changes. My personal fork on
GitHub should be the same as the GPars mainline repository. Last change
I see was 2015-09-07T23:32:36+01:00.--
