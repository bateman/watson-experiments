[â€¦]Groovy has no serious traction in the static world. Even with the
marketing push given by many people, including myself, Groovy has the
label "dynamic" firmly stuck to it; it is seen in the same grouping as
Clojure (and JRuby and Jython). When people are no discussing
refactoring of codebases then if the base language is Java then the
choice of language is Kotlin.This sounds like lazy staff misusing a dynamic language. People using
Groovy (and Clojure) as dynamic languages tend not to have this
problem.-- Russel.
