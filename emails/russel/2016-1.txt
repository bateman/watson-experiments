[â€¦]Someone used a Windows machine to commit (many) files which have \r\n
line endings. Linux person checks the files out, they have \r\n line
endings.This has been a ####### pain for me for years, so much so I stopped
even looking at the Groovy source code with a view to editing it.Most of your problems are likely related to which editor you are using.
Emacs does at least recognize DOS line endings and work accordingly.The core difficulty is that some files have \n line endings and other
have \r\n line endings. To me, this is an unacceptable state of
affairs. Given this is a Git repository, all line endings in all files
should be \n. No ifs, no buts, no mewling from Windows people, no
worrying about changing 400 files and the gross silliness of the
resultant commit logs.I think you should. Consistency of the repository far outweighs any
stupidness of a monster line endings commit. Currently some files have
\n and others \r\n, this means the repository is broken.No pull request with \r\n line endings should be acceptable. No commits
from committers with \r\n line endings should be acceptable.Windows users need to read about and act upon the git property
core.autocrlf before cloning the Groovy (or in fact any Git)
repository, and most especially before making a pull request or
pushing.I have just had to deal with this with another Git repository and a
Mercurial oneâ€¦--
