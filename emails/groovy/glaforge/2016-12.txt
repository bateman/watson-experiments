Hi Marcin,Some modules have used the groovyx.* namespace in the past.
It's somewhat semi-standard, in the sense that it's already in use, at
least.
It's not dependent upon Apache or the defunct Codehaus foundation, and
there's no constraint from Sonatype on those.
If using groovyx, it'd be good to continue using some kind of consensual
sub-namespace, like groovyx.net.* for network related modules.Guillaume--
