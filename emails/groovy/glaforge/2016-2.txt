I agree with CÃ©dric.
It'd be better to integrate the actual tips in the JavaDocs per se.
Furthermore, the Groovy's GroovyDoc can also contain code samples that are
actually tested, with assertions.
So not only would that improve the documentation itself, without going
through another hoop to visit a website elsewhere, but it'd also would
increase the number of tests, ensuring higher quality, less future
regressions, etc.
It's really not just a matter of clicking on a link to learn more.--
