I don't think it's been discussed yet.  I'd like to finish GROOVY-7465
 first, but I haven't
had the time to finish the unit testing I wanted to do.  So from my end,
maybe in a few weeks so I could wrap that up?  Somebody can finish what I
started if we really wanted to ship sooner.  I work on Groovy in my free
time, which I haven't had much of lately, so a few things have piled up on
my Groovy TODO list (in Groovy, Groovy-Eclipse, GMavenPlus, and Groovy
Native Launcher -- Sorry :(  ).-KeeganOn Sun, Sep 27, 2015 at 10:14 PM, Nicholas Grealy
