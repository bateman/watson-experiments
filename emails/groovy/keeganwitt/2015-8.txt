That's a ridiculously ancient version.  I doubt Eclipse is coded to support
the old goals that were in the 1.0 plugin (which is why you're seeing the
errors you're seeing).  I'm not familiar enough with Eclipse's codebase to
say why Eclipse is picking that version.  Upstream archetype-catalog.xml
has a much more recent version.  What I'd do is use Maven from the
commandline to use the archetype then import that into Eclipse.  Or just
don't use the archetype (it's a pretty simple setup anyway -- all it's
doing is creating a src/main/groovy and src/test/groovy, and plopping in
the GMaven XML into a POM).  That is, assuming you really want to use
GMaven.  It's not maintained anymore and I suggest consideringanother option.-KeeganOn Mon, Aug 31, 2015 at 11:22 AM, Richard Heintze
