from April 1st to April 29 the only easy bug left I find is GROOVY-7385, and even that one has 
traps. So I am not sure what from there would be suitableas soon a we find out for us how to do that I am sure it is nice. 
Getting there is a problem though... how difficult can a bug be to have 
it marked as "newcomer". Most bug are not really difficult, they just 
require deeper understanding of internals, and it can take a few weeks 
to get there... which is too long for most.bye blackdrag--
