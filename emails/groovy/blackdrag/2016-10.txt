I think the biggest mistake is to allow the general overloading of "=". 
Be it with some automated type coercion or another user over-writable 
mechanism. We have to some extend for assignment to Boolean with 
asBoolean, but not in general and not specialized for "=", especially 
not for arbitrary types. I think it was a big mistake for Scala to 
introduce something like this. It makes DSLs nicer, yes, but it makes it 
incredibly difficult for the programmer to follow the program flow.So if we add custom operators, we should ensure they fit in the general 
program flowbye Jochen
