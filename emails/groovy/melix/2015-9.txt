And to conclude: yes, we have added such committers to the project. For
reference, in addition to the initial list of committers, we added:- Dierk Koenig, non code committing so far, but Elder
- AndrÃ©s Almiray, pushed code once, but more importantly, another Elder
- Russel Winder, who is the definition of someone committed to the project
but not pushing code :)
- Keegan Witt, code pushing committerI honestly think we have a serious core here, and not all Apache projects,
including TLP, can say that they have such an active community...2015-09-30 9:20 GMT+02:00 Emmanuel LÃ©charny :
