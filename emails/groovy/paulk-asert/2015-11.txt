It might be interesting to have a reworked set of metrics which we
could apply on an as needed basis (perhaps once a quarter or once a
year) to reassess maturity on an on-going basis. But I agree the
current version (the wording at least) is very much geared towards
graduation from incubation so we don't want how it is in the current
form. I am also not keen to create more "overhead" work than needed so
it might be best to wait until we can almost automatically collect a
bunch of stats that could form the basis of the quarterly report to
the board.Paul.On Fri, Nov 20, 2015 at 5:33 AM, Bertrand Delacretaz
