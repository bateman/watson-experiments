I am fairly sure, actually I am certain otherwise I wouldn't have a
Groovy installation :-), I used to get a full build and deploy to the
install location before the asciidoc tasks started. So the issue is
what has changed in the build to change the order of task evaluation.This is not entirely a big deal for anyone else I guess, just me.
