I was able to replicate the error with the following code:interface Foo extends Iterable {
}@groovy.transform.CompileStatic
void test(Foo foo) {
    for (x in foo) {
        println 'ok'
    }
}In this example, the error occurs during class generation while writing the
`for` statement in the test(Foo) method.The error no longer seems to occur as of Groovy 2.3.8.
