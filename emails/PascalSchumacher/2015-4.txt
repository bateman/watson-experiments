Hi Benedikt,thanks for the hint. :)My knowledge of git is very limited, so excuse me if I'm wrong, did you 
use the--no-ff to create this commit:?I'm asking, because github shows you as the author of the commit. That 
is something I would like to avoid (if possible), because I believe it's 
detrimental to the motivation of contributers.- PascalBy the way: I really wish I would be able to contribute as much to open 
source as you do. Congrats! :)Am 29.04.2015 um 15:07 schrieb Benedikt Ritter:
