Hello everyone,Paul and John fixed a lot of issues recently, so there are now 44 fixed 
issues:The last release was three months ago and people are waiting for a new 
release, e.g.: I think this calls for a new release.What do you think?-PascalP.S.: I am repeating myself, but I think we should also release a 
2.5.0-beta (even without the macro documentation).
