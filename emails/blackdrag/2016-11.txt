[...][...]This is actually not so easy to explain, since this is a side-effect of 
the way the grammar for the parser is written... and they are 
potentially bugs.if you have foo {}, then this is seen as a complete method call, the 
parser simply does not expect further arguments after the {} if you wrap 
the whole thing in parens, you actually have a different rule applying, 
which explains why it works there. But that is actually not precise 
enough. we have also a different rule for foo {} and foo 1, {}. So imho 
the parser simply applies the wrong rule first and the problems you see 
are a result of priorities... or missing lookaheadbye Jochen
