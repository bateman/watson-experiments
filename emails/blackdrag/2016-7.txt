We have a method in DGM:meaning Object itself provides a getAt method that uses getProperty - 
well, actually it is equal to self.$property. Which of course means if 
you add a getAt(Object) method and call this with a String or GString, 
we still call the above method. Which also explains your problem ;)bye Jochen
