bit misguided. We have the zip distribution and the jars that go to 
maven. The maven artifacts of course would stay as they are, this is 
only about the zip distribution.[...]The reason that we have the version numbers there basically is, that the 
jars in the zip are the same jars as for maven, that's why they have 
version numbers. It was not all that of a big deal before we started 
having 17+ modules.[...]license information must go into the LICENSE and NOTICE (and DISCLAIMER) 
files as per ASF requirements. Checksums are imho not making sense as 
part of the zip, because if the zip is manipulated, then it is no use to 
use the zip contents to verify the zip contents. As for the version 
number... I think a file VERSION is often used for that.But Steve, I do have a question...
Normally the things you describe are part of the installation process as 
well as making a package for the system installation. That means 
normally you want a system package. Installing software packages 
manually in a system with a packaging manager is usually a bad idea.GVM was mentioned, but GVM is not for a system-wide installation like 
Steve wants it. And it is (currently) not a way to provide libraries for 
usage by applications outside of a GVM package.As for how.... changing distSpec in assemble.groovy to include some 
renames may do it. Anyone interested in doing a pull request? Of course 
I would also like to hear Cedric as our current build master about this.bye blackdrag--
