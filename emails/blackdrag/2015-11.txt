If the class is made to be thread safe, then it will need quite a bit 
work on the synchronization. As it is now, it is far from threadsafe. 
That already starts with the multiple locks in use and if that is really 
correct - multiple locks in methods calling each other can easily create 
deadlocks for example.bye blackdrag
