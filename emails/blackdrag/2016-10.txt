[...]exactly. The same applies to the usage of categories and to methods 
added to the meta class. The problem is reduced if we delegate to the 
implementation of an interface and all the important logic is based on 
the interface type. Because @Delegate per default implements the 
interfaces of the delegates.It is not an either-or. You can do both, causing less load for 
methodMissing and faster dispatch.Presuming the availability and usage of certain extension methods is 
imho ok for the static compiler, but not for dynamic Groovy - not if you 
expect a runtime added extension method to have influencebye Jochen
