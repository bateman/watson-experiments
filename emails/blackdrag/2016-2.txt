in case of Chameleon implements ColorChanging the answer is yes. In case of... no. Here Chameleon does not know anything about the trait and the 
trait isused like a facade around the object. For the same reason 
mylizard is an instance of ColorChanging, but not of Chameleon anymoreIt could probably made possible, if you change the meta class used for 
the Chameleon object you proxy with the trait. But there is no such 
implementation right nowbye Jochen
