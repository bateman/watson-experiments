in the first case you are accessing a local variable, which is done 
without bothering with owner and delegate of the Closure instance. In 
the second case you are going through these to find the meaning of the 
magicValue. But since you use rehydrate to set owner and delegate to 
null, you will end up in an error.  Why do you do rehydrate at all? 
Maybe in your bigger code there is a need for this I won't see here, but 
in what I see I obviously fail to see the need. If you have to use it, 
then of course you will have to set owner and/or delegate, or else you 
won't be able to sue the standard mechanisms to access the binding from 
the Closure instancebye Jochen
