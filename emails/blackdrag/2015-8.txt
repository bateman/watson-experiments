normal Groovy. That's why you can for example assign a long to a byte

has been forgottenthat looks like a bug to melooks like char conversion is missing some aspects. I guess this is also 
due to the analogy of 1-char Strings and Character we use in normal 
Groovy (not supported by @CompileStatic) which did let us forget about 
some transformationsbye blackdrag--
