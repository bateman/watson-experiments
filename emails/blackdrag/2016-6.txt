Hi all,I know I can close a github pull request using a commit message, and I 
know we cannot do it using the UI (as long as I am not the author of the 
request at least), because it is a read-only mirror. But is there really 
no other way to close a pull request... for example one I want not to 
merge? Making dummy commits to master is not really a good thing. Afaik 
making a commit to another branch won't close itbye Jochen
