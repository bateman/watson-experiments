This require support through the JVM... and actually Java8 has that... 
But I think we do not support that yet. I am unhappy about the semantics 
of static methods in general in Java and that we copied most of it in 
Groovy... extending that to interface is for me no good decision... but 
well...I guess it is up to you. I know of nothing in that area to make this 
less painfulbye Jochen
