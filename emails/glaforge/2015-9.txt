Hi all,Lots of Groovy ecosystem fans are moving to Washington DC this week for the
SpringOne2GX show, and just before taking my flight, I thought that would
be a good idea to share the latest edition of your favorite Groovy column
:-)If you're attending the conference, please come and talk with me and tell
me you're reading Groovy Weekly :-)--
