And Groovy developers read the users list as well of course :-)Moving from 1.7.4 to 2.4.4 is a big leap, as there have been a 96 versions
released in between, if I count correctly!!!
5 years have passed between those two release!!!But I can understand the motto "why fix what ain't broke" ;-)The Groovy team does its best to make Groovy as backward-compatible as
possible, but there have been some minor breaking changes here and there to
fix some incorrect behavior, plus some changes which might have an impact â€”
sometimes certain things are not really specified or covered by our test
suites, so people can rely on some aspects which might potentially evolve.Frankly, the best thing you can do at this point is just try it out!
See if you get errors, and come back to us (on the users list) with the
problems you might be encountering.Guillaume--
