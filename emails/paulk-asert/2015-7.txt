qdox is used in docgenerator. Groovydoc uses the Java and Groovy grammars for parsing Java and Groovy files respectively but since neither grammar currently contains the comments Groovydoc uses a slightly fragile comment scrapping approach to pull out the class comments, method comments, etc. We could invest more time in to making the comment scrapping less fragile but we've been thinking it preferable to invest time into getting onto the Antlr 4 grammar and then adding in comment support (perhaps leveraging the work done in the Eclipse compiler plugin).For whatever reason, it looks like the subproject package.html files are being processed and the ones from core are being missed.Cheers, Paul.---
