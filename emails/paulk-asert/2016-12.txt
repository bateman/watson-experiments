That is the current expected behaviour. The grammar currently doesn't
support slashy syrings straight after println unless you add the
parentheses. I can't recall the rationale just now. Perhaps it's something
we could look at in the Parrot parser - or an attempt to add it might make
it clear what the rationale is/was.Cheers, Paul
