Subject: Calling Ant target â€œcollectâ€ from Groovy
To: dev@groovy.incubator.apache.orgI am trying to replace run our test suite with Jenkins pipeline, during this
for the old ant file we are writing Groovy script where for the Ant target
"collect" how can I replace it with the Groovy script.I tried below code :Groovy script is :Project project1=new Project()
project1.init()
project1.initProperties()
project1.setProperty("includes","com*.xml")
project1.setProperty("output-file","test-results.xml")
ProjectHelper projectHelper1=new ProjectHelper()
projectHelper1.parse(project1,antFile)
project1.executeTarget("collect")The problem is that how can I use the dir="${eclipse_home}" in groovy ?--
