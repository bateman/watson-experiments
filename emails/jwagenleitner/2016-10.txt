I had aimed for making it as flexible as possible and purposefully had it
not participate in further processing to avoid surprises and be able to
output JSON that otherwise wouldn't be possible due to the way the
generator was already configured (nulls or being able to write out a number
such as 9.3e7).I like your suggestion and think the flexibility could still be
accomplished using JsonOutput.unescaped; and since 2.5 isn't out yet
there's still time to refine how it works.I also would like to hear what others think.John
