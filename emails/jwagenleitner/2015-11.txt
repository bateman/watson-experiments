Hi acefael,Probably would be good to open a JIRA for this, definitely looks like an
issue with the block of code you identified.  I do believe the general
intent of the Sql class is to be thread safe.  As Pascal pointed out, there
might be other issues if calls are made to methods that cause a cached
connection.  But at a quick glance the caching of the parsed named
parameter queries looks separate from connection and statement caching.Are you calling sql.close() from any of the closures?  Just wondering since
close() clears both maps.John[1]
