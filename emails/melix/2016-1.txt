Your benchmark is wrong, because the caller is not statically compiled.
What you have statically compiled is the `Test` class, but the caller is
not. So when you do `t.setMember(..)`, the call is dynamic. It's the caller
that you have to statically compile (or both, ideally).2016-01-21 16:39 GMT+01:00 Marshall, Simon :
