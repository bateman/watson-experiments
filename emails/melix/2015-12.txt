You are actually talking about the second error, but it's a direct
consequence of flow typing (that Scala doesn't have). And if we didn't have
that, no doubt that even more frustration would come (look at the history
of type checking bugs for type inference of literals to get an idea).2015-12-02 16:23 GMT+01:00 Dinko SrkoÄ :
